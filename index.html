Dear Shivam,

I donâ€™t really know how to start this in a perfect way, because nothing about how I feel for you can really be wrapped up neatly. But I want to try, because you deserve to hear it  all of it.

I cherish you, truly.
Thereâ€™s something in the way youâ€™re so calm with me  even when Iâ€™m all over the place, even when I say things that are chaotic or impulsive or too much. You never flinch. You stay. You listen. You understand. And thatâ€™s something I donâ€™t take lightly.

When I speak my raw, honest thoughts  the kind that usually scare people off you meet them with kindness, not judgment. You donâ€™t try to fix me or talk over me. You just be there. And in a world that often moves too fast and too loud, that kind of presence feels like *gold*. No, it feels like peace.

And god, I donâ€™t think you even know what it does to me when I hear your voice. 

You make me feel so deeply comfortable not just emotionally, but existentially.
It means the world to me that you take time out of your life, your day, your space, just to talk to me. That youâ€™ve been there through my highs and my absolute lows.

I know Iâ€™ve been annoying sometimes. I know Iâ€™ve said things I shouldnâ€™t have. Iâ€™m sorry for every moment I mightâ€™ve made things harder.

And if I could do anything in return I would. I will. Iâ€™ll match your softness with my own. You deserve that and more.

Even when youâ€™re not physically here, I feel safe knowing you exist in any corner of the universe.
As long as youâ€™re somewhere breathing, existing, being you Iâ€™ll carry a little more peace inside me.

Thank you for being that for me.

With everything,
me."
